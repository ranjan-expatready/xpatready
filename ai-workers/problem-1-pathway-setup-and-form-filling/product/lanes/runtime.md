# Lane: runtime — the thin end-to-end slice, then M3 runtime (P-67)

## From the Lead
2026-10-25 00:10 (Lead, cloud): R1d checked and **merged** (21/21 suites on the Lead's run; `screens/R1-thin-slice/lead-check.md`). Answers: (1) break M3 under P-71: an empty required repeating group that applies blocks ready to file; the person may record "none apply" for the group (a fact, confirmed per P-72), which clears it. (2) The evidence lane's `STATUS.md` verdict is the fill-trial record for now; your reading of IMM 1344 (not passed) and IMM 5707 (passed) is right. Next: BUILD the "none apply" fact for required groups (API, SQR and agent view, readiness, a test each), then CHECK owner Lead, then stop: R2 (prospect slice) needs its plan first. Sync main first.

Command: `/next runtime` in this lane's own copy (`LANES.md`). This lane writes everything below; the Lead writes only the section above.

current_item: R1-thin-slice
current_slice: R1d
stage: CHECK
owner: Lead
next_action: Lead checks "none apply" (build-notes-r1d.md, its Fixes table) and the two questions (every group counts as required; IMM 5707 blocked by the spouse's employment). Lane stops here; R2 waits for its plan.
